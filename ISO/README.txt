How to run the quality program.

1. Add the programs to you matlab path.
2. Run the constants script - it contains global definitions 
3. Run the function test_sorting - this function gets a trace 
   of a raw analog signal and a vector of the indices of the detected spikes. 
   It then calculated all the quality parameters.
